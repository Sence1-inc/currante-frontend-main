## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:Sence1-inc/currante-frontend-main.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd currante-frontend-main
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Development

To start the development server, run:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and open your default web browser to display the application.

### Building for Production

## Additional Configuration

### Import without File Extension

In this project, you can import TypeScript and TypeScript React files without specifying the file extension (`.ts` or `.tsx`). Vite is configured to resolve these file types automatically.

For example:

```
import MyComponent from './components/MyComponent';
```

### Backend API

To use the APIs in this project, you need to run the `currante-backend-main` backend server. Please refer to the backend documentation for instructions on setting up and running the backend server.
